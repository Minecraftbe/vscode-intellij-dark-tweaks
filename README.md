## Introduction

This project contains selected configurations extracted from my VS Code `settings.json`, primarily used to **customize syntax highlighting colors for code snippets**. These settings are fine-tuned based on the **Dark Theme** style from the [IntelliJ IDEA New UI Theme](https://marketship.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-theme-intellij-new-ui) extension, adjusted to better match my personal visual preferences and coding habits.

## Usage Instructions

1. Install the [IntelliJ IDEA New UI Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=compassak.intellij-idea-new-ui) extension. (This is the most faithful IntelliJ IDEA theme I've seen.)
2. Set `Semantic Highlighting` to `false`.
3. Process and copy the relevant configurations from this repository into your VS Code `settings.json` file (accessible via `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` → type “Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)”).
4. Adjust color values or scopes as needed.

## Notes

- This configuration has **not been thoroughly tested** and may behave unexpectedly with certain languages or extensions.
- **Not recommended for direct use in production environments**—always back up your original configuration locally first.
- This configuration is primarily tailored for **Python** syntax highlighting and therefore may not fully align with all JetBrains IDEs.
- This configuration is designed specifically for use **with semantic highlighting disabled**; some settings may be overridden when semantic highlighting is enabled.
